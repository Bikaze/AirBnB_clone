## Web static

After the command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

**This is our progress. We we've implemented the console and now we're making a static webpage for our website.**
